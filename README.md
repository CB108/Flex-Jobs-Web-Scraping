# Flex-Jobs-Web-Scraping
This was a preliminary EDA into the question - "How can I best spend my time and energy while sesarching for a Data Analyst position?"

The goal was to gain insight into the current job-market by understanding which hard-skills were listed most frequently, and to get a birds-eye view of which words came up most in general in the job-descriptions. 

This data was extracted from www.flexjobs.com and the search performed was 'Data Analyst' in the search field and 'Remote' in the location field.
